# Point cloud quality enhancement based on deep learning

The updated papers about the quality enhancement of point clouds, including three topics:

- point cloud completion 

- point cloud up-sampling/super resolution

- point cloud denoising



## **Point cloud completion**

- ### Voxel-based methods
